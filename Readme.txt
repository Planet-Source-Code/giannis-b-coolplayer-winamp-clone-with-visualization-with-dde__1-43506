This is the new release of my player.
Finally, i've made the visualization part!
It's not finished, i must make a function that reads the VISCOLOR.TXT, to paint correctly the spectrum.
Also i've made many modifications and corrections.
For comments or/and suggestions, just mail me at giannis@usa.com

Read this, to avoid run problems...

For compiled EXE:

1.  Compile the EXE project in any folder you like. Then create a subfolder, called (Plugins) and a subfolder called (Skins)
Attention: Dont run the EXE!!!

2. If you have finished with step 1, compile those 2 DLL projects into the (Plugins) folder.
Attention: Dont run the EXE!!!

3. In the ZIP you'll find a folder called (Base). Copy it and paste it into the (Skins) folder.
Now you can run the EXE!!!

For code run:
Create a subfolder called (Plugins) and a subfolder called (Skins) into the Main Project's folder.
Go to step 2 and step 3.

NOTE: If the visualization does not work, do the following:
RightClick on the player's main window and then click (Sound card...) or
go to Control Panel and click Sound and Audio Devices, then select the Audio tab.

Click on Sound Recording, the button (Volume...). Go to Options menu, then click Properties and then check ALL the list, click OK.
Now just try to select the recording device, that will work with my player. For any problems just mail me at giannis@usa.com.
